# DIP_Group6_Camulet
This repository is the 2023 final project for the NTU Digital Image Processing course. 
We aim to create an AR game with Unity AR Foundation, themed around the Dual Helix Plaza and Loop Garden. Players must carefully navigate through the Dual Helix Maze, avoiding electric fields, and 
tap the screen to collect mythical creatures that appear in the Dual Helix Plaza. The goal is to successfully navigate out of the Dual Helix Maze.

## Build & Run
1. Clone this repository and install Unity 2023.2.0b12
2. Open the Unity project at the root of this repository.
3. Go to Build Settings, select Android platform, choose CamuletFinalVersion scene, and build this scene.

## Elements
- Anchor: Placed at the entrance of the Dual Helix, used for positioning the spiral and various objects.
- Electric Field: A hazardous obstacle appearing above the Dual Helix.
- Flowers: Appearing at the periphery of the spiral, presenting a garden concept.
- Dragons: Collect (tap) mythical creature friends to navigate out of the Dual Helix maze.
